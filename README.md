# Getting Started with The Weather App

The minimal weather application is based on showing the daily and hourly weather forecast via OpenWeatherAPI. It was developed by using React.js, Redux, Tailwind CSS, and react-slick.

You can find the development notes below.

## Development Details

1. I didn't use any utility libraries. All the algorithms are written by me.

2. I have used TailwindCSS for the styling of the application and reducing the CSS size with PurgeCSS plugin.

3. Communication among components was mostly made by Redux Toolkit.

4. I have tried to write comprehensive, maintainable codes. I have added lines of comment when needed.

5. The Application is fully responsive for all the screens.

6. Please give me feedback about the application. It's important for understanding my mistakes.
